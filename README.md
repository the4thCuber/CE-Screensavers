# CE-Screensavers
<h5>This is a place for committing screensavers written in assembly, C, ICE, or BASIC that work on the TI- 84 Plus CE.</h5>
  <h4>Instructions for Contributors</h4>
<p>If you wish to commit a new program, create a folder on main named with the name of your program.<br>
Put a readme for your program in the file with a short description, as well as the 8xp, 8ek, 8xl, 8ci, or 8xv files your program requires.<br>
Readmes are preferably .txt, since that file format is more universal than .md, as well as being simpler, so it uses less memory and is more easily compressible.<br>
If the author of a program puts their name in the readme for that program, please give them credit if you use any of their code.<br></p>
<p>The reason for the existence of this repository is so I can make a screensaver suite for the CE, so please only commit your programs if you are okay with them appearing in Cemetech archives.</p>
<p>All programs are released under the GPL3. Honor system until it's included.</p>
<p>Note: all the programs by Iamaprogramador (me) have demo videos on the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUsgeD_maLp1kb1Adm4bERg">here</a></p><hr>
Thank you for contributing!<br>
