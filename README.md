# CE-Screensavers
This is a place for committing screensavers written in assembly, C, ICE, or BASIC that work on the TI- 84 Plus CE.
This is a repository for screensaver/graphic programs for the TI-84 Plus CE.
If you wish to commit a new program, create a folder on main named with the name of your program.
Put a readme for your program in the file with a short description, as well as the 8xp, 8ek, 8xl, 8ci, or 8xv files your program requires.
If the author of a program puts their name in the readme, please give them credit if you use any of their code.
The reason for the existence of this repository is so I can make a screensaver suite for the CE, so please only commit your programs if you are okay with them appearing on Cemetech and ticalc.
