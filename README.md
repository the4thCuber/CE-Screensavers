# CE-Screensavers
This is a place for committing screensavers written in assembly, C, ICE, or BASIC that work on the TI- 84 Plus CE.
This is a repository for screensaver/graphic programs for the TI-84 Plus CE.
If you wish to commit a new program, create a folder on main named with the name of your program.
Put a readme for your program in the file with a short description, as well as the 8xp, 8ek, 8xl, 8ci, or 8xv files your program requires.
Readmes are preferably .txt, since that file format is more universal than .md, as well as being simpler, so it uses less memory and is more easily compressible.
If the author of a program puts their name in the readme, please give them credit if you use any of their code.
The reason for the existence of this repository is so I can make a screensaver suite for the CE, so please only commit your programs if you are okay with them appearing on Cemetech, and possibly ticalc.org.
