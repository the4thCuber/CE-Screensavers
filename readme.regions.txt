These region programs generate an image on the calculator screen by a sort of gravitational computation.
Simply run the program from Cesium or the homescreen, with the 'Asm(' token if below OS 5.3.
You may press [clear] to exit at any time (although possibly messing up the calc if you ran the program from TI-OS, since there's no way to end the graphics), and press [enter] to exit after the image finishes.
